Program Description:
  A basic webpage to introduce myself and display my skills and experience. The webpage was mainly 
  built with HTML and CSS, Javascript was used to cycle through a compilation of images.
  
  The webpage highlights my education, the technologies I am familiar with, my achievements,
  my work experience, and some personal projects.
  
  The webpage proved to be a very valuable learning experience, helping me to gain an understanding
  of HTML and CSS, as well as how scripts can be incorporated to create dynamic content.
  

Further Improvements:
  Webpage components need to be sized dynamically so that it can fit to different viewport sizes.
  A few components need to be realigned.
